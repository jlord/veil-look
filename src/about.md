Hello! I am Jessica Lord. I am a software engineer; though my career started in architecture and urban design technology. I have this second site for I don't know what reason. Here's the [other](http://jlord.us).

I know lots of people who also like tech and open source and JavaScript. I know less who also like cities, etymology, Vikings, medieval England, Denmark and Danish design, art history and the Dutch Golden Age, Disneyland, high speed trains. Which is maybe what Iâ€™ll talk more about here?

I'm elsewhere on the world wide web:

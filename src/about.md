Hello! I am Jessica Lord. I am a software engineer; though my career started in architecture and urban design technology. I have this second site for I don't know what reason. Here's the [other](http://jlord.us).

I know lots of people who also like tech and open source and JavaScript. I know less who also like cities, etymology, Vikings, medieval England, Denmark and Danish design, art history and the Dutch Golden Age, Disneyland, high speed trains. Which is maybe what I’ll talk more about here?

I'm elsewhere on the world wide web:

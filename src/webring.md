[Monica](https://twitter.com/notwaldorf) and I built a webring of sorts ([remember those](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webring)?) out of Glitch collections. You can create a collection of sites you like on Glitch and create a site like this ([remix the original](https://glitch.com/~geoglitchies)) to have a page just like this, that shows those sites.

View my [collection on Glitch](https://glitch.com/@jlord/frands). There's not really much in it, it is more to demonstrate that we could. Enjoy!

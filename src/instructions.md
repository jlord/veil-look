This here that you are reading is a Glitch project, so to create your own blog that is identical,
you just have to remix this. You can click this!

### Add New Posts
All posts live in `src/`. There are 3 posts in this sample project:
  - `index.md`, the üè°.
  - `instructions.md`, which you are reading right now.
  - `sample-post.md`, which is an example post that you can duplicate over and over again for new content.

To create a new post, duplicate `sample-post.md` ([link](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/ballistic-piranha?path=src/sample-post.md:7:107)),
and start writing! This should automatically redeploy your site!

### Customize it
This blog is written using [eleventy](https://www.11ty.io/), which is a static site generator. The docs are pretty helpful,
but the TL; DR is:
- The "look" of the different pages is in `src/_includes/layouts`. There are two layouts in this project
  - `home.njk`, used by the `index.md` post.
  - `post.njk`, used by all the other posts.
- These are HTML + [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) files, and if you want your pages to look different,
this is what you should modify.
- The styles come from `css/style.css`.

## Webring
[Webrings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webring) are websites linked together. You know, your internet friends.

We use [Glitch collections](https://support.glitch.com/t/get-organized-with-collections/8038) to add your friends' blogs to your webring.

1. Create a Glitch collection.
2. Add its name to `src/_data/siteData.json` ([link](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/ballistic-piranha?path=src/_data/siteData.json:3:19)),
in the "collection" field. For example, the
  collection we're using in this sample is at [glitch.com/@jlord/frands](https://glitch.com/@jlord/frands"),
  so we added `"collection": "notwaldorf/frands"` to the config file.
3. Start adding projects to that collection!
3. That's it! The projects will be automatically populated (if you're interested, that code is
[here](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/ballistic-piranha?path=src/_data/friends.js:11:6)).
